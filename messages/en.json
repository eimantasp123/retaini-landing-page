        "paragraph1": "Every time I visit the same hairdresser, trainer or massage therapist, I realize how often I recommend them to friends. And Iâ€™m not alone â€“ we all do it naturally. But what happens next?",
        "paragraph2": "The friend comes, enjoys the service â€“ but the service provider has no idea who referred them. Thereâ€™s no thank you, no recognition, no relationship. That loyalty goes unnoticed.",
        "paragraph3": "Thatâ€™s when businesses start looking for solutions â€“ often turning to big, complex CRM systems. Expensive, overloaded with features small businesses donâ€™t need. What they really want is simple: to see who is helping them grow and to say thank you.",
        "paragraph4": "That's why I created Retaini â€“ a simple, human tool that allows businesses to track referrals, reward loyal customers, and build genuine, long-term relationships. No complex CRMs, no headaches. Just value â€“ where it begins: in the relationship with a loyal customer."
